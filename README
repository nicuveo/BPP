Brain++ is the stupidest idea ever: what if I preprocessed Brainfuck files with the C preprocessor? What if I used BOOST_PP?
The result is Brain++: a collection of utility functions and constants for Brainfuck.

Are included:
  * numerical constants from 0 to 255,
  * ascii constants covering most of the ascii table,
  * main mathematical binary operators,
  * memory operations (cp, mv...),
  * boolean logic,
  * string operations,
  * a small test file.

For lulz and glory.
